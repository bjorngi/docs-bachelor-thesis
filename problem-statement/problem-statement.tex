\section{Problem}
Our houses are dumb. We leave them with light, heat, TV and other devices on, and it does nothing about
it! The amount of electricity wasted on an empty house I believe to be very high, and the only way to
make people turn down their heat and off their lights before leaving is to do it for them.

There is a growing trend to making houses ``smart'', but there is a significant cost of entry when
doing so. This cost includes expensive commercial home automation system and then pay someone to
redo your electrical system to accommodate for this new system. After revamping your house with this
new fancy home automation system, you are pretty much destined to live there for a long time to get
return on your investment.

\section{Research Question}
Is there a way to make home automation affordable for everyone, and make it possible to take it with
you when changing residence?

\section{Method}
The development of this software will be done using Test Driven Development and using GitHub issues
as backlog and planning tool. The system will be tested in my own home trough the development. If I
can live with it, hopefully someone else can too.
